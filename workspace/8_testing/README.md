# Python Testing Fundamentals

A comprehensive guide to testing in Python, covering essential concepts, frameworks, and best practices for writing reliable, maintainable code.

## What is Testing?

Testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system functions as expected. In Python development, testing helps ensure your code works correctly, catches bugs early, and maintains quality as your project grows.

### Why Testing Matters:
- **Quality Assurance**: Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Confidence**: Make changes without fear of breaking existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how your code should behave
- **Maintainability**: Easier to refactor and improve code with test coverage
- **Collaboration**: Team members can understand expected behavior through tests

## Types of Testing

### 1. **Unit Testing**
- Tests individual functions or methods in isolation
- Fast to run and easy to maintain
- Forms the foundation of your test suite
- **Example**: Testing a single calculation function

### 2. **Integration Testing**
- Tests how different components work together
- Verifies data flow between modules
- **Example**: Testing database operations with business logic

### 3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
- Tests complete user workflows
- Validates the entire application stack
- **Example**: Testing user login through web interface

### 4. **Functional Testing**
- Tests specific functionality requirements
- Focuses on what the system does, not how
- **Example**: Testing API endpoints return correct data

## Python Testing Frameworks

### pytest (Recommended)
```python
def test_addition():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple, readable syntax
- Powerful assertion introspection
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- Excellent fixture system
- Compatible with unittest

### unittest (Built-in)
```python
import unittest

class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
```

**Advantages:**
- Part of Python standard library
- Object-oriented approach
- xUnit-style testing
- Built-in test discovery

### doctest (Built-in)
```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(-1, 1)
    0
    """
    return a + b
```

**Advantages:**
- Tests embedded in docstrings
- Serves as documentation
- Easy to write and maintain

## Testing Tools & Libraries

### Test Runners
- **pytest**: Most popular, feature-rich
- **unittest**: Built-in Python module
- **nose2**: Extension of unittest
- **tox**: Testing across multiple Python versions

### Mocking & Fixtures
- **unittest.mock**: Built-in mocking library
- **pytest fixtures**: Dependency injection for tests
- **factory_boy**: Generate test data
- **faker**: Create realistic fake data

### Coverage Tools
- **coverage.py**: Measure code coverage
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage plugin for pytest
- **codecov/coveralls**: Online coverage reporting

### Automation & CI/CD
- **tox**: Test automation across environments
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for quality checks

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. **Test Structure (AAA Pattern)**
```python
def test_user_creation():
    # Arrange - Set up test data
    username = "testuser"
    email = "test@example.com"

    # Act - Perform the action
    user = create_user(username, email)

    # Assert - Verify the results
    assert user.username == username
    assert user.email == email
    assert user.id is not None
```

### 2. **Test Naming Conventions**
- Use descriptive names: `test_user_login_with_valid_credentials()`
- Follow pattern: `test_[function]_[condition]_[expected_result]()`
- Be specific about what you're testing

### 3. **Test Independence**
- Each test should run independently
- Tests should not depend on execution order
- Use fixtures for setup and teardown

### 4. **One Assertion Per Test (Guideline)**
```python
# Good - focused test
def test_user_has_correct_username():
    user = create_user("john", "john@example.com")
    assert user.username == "john"

def test_user_has_correct_email():
    user = create_user("john", "john@example.com")
    assert user.email == "john@example.com"
```

### 5. **Test Edge Cases**
- Empty inputs
- Boundary values
- Error conditions
- Invalid data types

### 6. **Use Fixtures for Setup**
```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_user():
    return User(username="testuser", email="test@example.com")

def test_user_can_login(sample_user):
    assert sample_user.authenticate("password123")
```

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### The TDD Cycle:
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

### Benefits:
- Better code design
- Higher test coverage
- Reduced debugging time
- Clear requirements understanding

### Example TDD Workflow:
```python
# 1. Red - Write failing test
def test_calculate_tax():
    assert calculate_tax(100, 0.1) == 10

# 2. Green - Write minimal implementation
def calculate_tax(amount, rate):
    return amount * rate

# 3. Refactor - Improve the implementation
def calculate_tax(amount, rate):
    """Calculate tax with input validation."""
    if amount < 0 or rate < 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount and rate must be positive")
    return round(amount * rate, 2)
```

## Common Testing Patterns

### 1. **Parametrized Tests**
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", [
    (2, 3, 5),
    (0, 0, 0),
    (-1, 1, 0),
    (10, -5, 5)
])
def test_addition(a, b, expected):
    assert add(a, b) == expected
```

### 2. **Exception Testing**
```python
def test_division_by_zero():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        divide(10, 0)
```

### 3. **Mocking External Dependencies**
```python
from unittest.mock import patch, Mock

@patch('requests.get')
def test_api_call(mock_get):
    mock_get.return_value.json.return_value = {'status': 'success'}

    result = fetch_data_from_api()

    assert result['status'] == 'success'
    mock_get.assert_called_once()
```

## Code Coverage

### What is Coverage?
Code coverage measures how much of your code is executed by your tests, expressed as a percentage.

### Types of Coverage:
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches taken
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called

### Coverage Tools:
```bash
# Install coverage
pip install coverage pytest-cov

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=myproject tests/

# Generate HTML report
coverage html
```

### Coverage Best Practices:
- Aim for 80-90% coverage (100% isn't always practical)
- Focus on critical business logic
- Don't sacrifice test quality for coverage numbers
- Use coverage to find untested code, not as the only metric

## Continuous Integration (CI)

### Benefits of CI:
- Automated testing on every commit
- Early detection of integration issues
- Consistent testing environment
- Automated deployment pipeline

### GitHub Actions Example:
```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, '3.10', 3.11]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install pytest pytest-cov
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Common Testing Antipatterns to Avoid

1. **Testing Implementation Details**: Test behavior, not internal implementation
2. **Overly Complex Tests**: Keep tests simple and focused
3. **Testing Everything**: Focus on critical paths and business logic
4. **Ignoring Test Maintenance**: Keep tests up-to-date as code evolves
5. **Poor Test Data Management**: Use factories and fixtures appropriately

## Quick Tips

- **Start Small**: Begin with simple unit tests (`/tox/math_utils/`)
- **Progress to Integration**: Move to API testing (`/tox/math_utils_api/`)
- **Test First**: Try writing tests before implementation
- **Keep Tests Fast**: Slow tests discourage frequent running
- **Use Meaningful Names**: Test names should explain what's being tested
- **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent
- **Test Edge Cases**: Don't just test the happy path
- **Automate Quality**: Use Tox for consistent testing environments
