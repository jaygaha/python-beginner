# Gevent

Gevent is a Python library that provides asynchronous programming using greenlets (lightweight threads) and an event loop. It allows you to write synchronous-looking code that runs asynchronously, making it easier to handle thousands of concurrent connections.


## Key concepts:

- Greenlets: Lightweight, cooperative threads
- Event Loop: Manages and schedules greenlets
- Monkey Patching: Makes standard library functions gevent-aware
- Non-blocking I/O: Operations don't block the entire program

### Greenlets

The primary pattern used in gevent is the Greenlet, a lightweight coroutine provided to Python as a C extension module. Greenlets all run inside of the OS process for the main program but are scheduled cooperatively.

> Only one greenlet is ever running at any given time.

## Installation

To install Gevent, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install gevent
```

## Usage

To use Gevent, you can import the `gevent` module and use its functions to create and manage greenlets.

```python
import gevent

def my_function():
    print("Hello, world!")

gevent.spawn(my_function).join()
```
## When to Use Gevent?

- Networking services
- Concurrent I/O operations
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat servers)
- When you want concurrency without threads or processes overhead
