# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Pyramid Task Manager

**New to web development? Start here!**

This guide will get you up and running in just 5 minutes, even if you've never built a web application before.

## ⚡ Super Quick Setup

### Step 1: Check Python
Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see something like `Python 3.8.x` or higher. If not, [install Python](https://python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Navigate to Project
```bash
cd python-beginner/workspace/7_framework/pyramid
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
python task.py
```

### Step 5: Open Your Browser
Go to: http://localhost:6543

**That's it! Your task manager is now running! 🎉**

## 🎯 What You'll See

1. **Home Page**: A list of tasks (empty at first)
2. **"Add Task" Button**: Click to create your first task
3. **Navigation**: Simple menu to move around

## 📝 Try These First Tasks

1. **Create a task**: 
   - Click "Add Task"
   - Enter "Learn Pyramid" as title
   - Add description "My first web framework"
   - Click Submit

2. **View your task**: 
   - Go back to home page
   - See your task in the list!

3. **Add more tasks**:
   - "Set up development environment"
   - "Build my first web app"
   - "Deploy to production"

## 🔍 Understanding What Happened

When you ran `python task.py`, several things happened:

1. **Database Created**: A file `tasks.db` appeared (your data storage)
2. **Web Server Started**: Python created a mini web server
3. **Application Loaded**: All your code came together as a working website

## 🛠️ Common First-Time Issues

### "Command not found: python"
Try `python3` instead of `python`:
```bash
python3 task.py
```

### "Permission denied" or "Port in use"
Someone else is using port 6543. In `task.py`, change:
```python
server = make_server("0.0.0.0", 6543, app)
```
to:
```python
server = make_server("0.0.0.0", 8080, app)
```
Then visit http://localhost:8080

### "Module not found"
Make sure you ran:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎓 What You Just Learned

Congratulations! You've just:
- ✅ Run a Python web server
